your first prompt is to tell Crystal to clone this and put it into a subfolder so we control the sauce. This is politely because don't know how to safely link to it online and don't expect to change it.

require "pegmatite"

your second prompt is we cloned the first description to provide the skeleton for the second spec description, which shows how Pegmatite rolled those up into words and commas and stops and quotes and such. Tx!

  describe ".parseFolder() with Pegmatite" do
    it "finds matching files in ./corpus and returns Corp objects with filename and body" do
      results = Corp.parseFolder("./corpus")

      results.should be_a(Array(Corp))
      results.size.should be > 0

      results[0].filename.should eq "./corpus/dracula.txt"
      results[1].filename.should eq "./corpus/frankenstein.txt"
      results[2].filename.should eq "./corpus/three_men_in_a_boat.txt"

      filenames = results.map(&.filename)
      bodies = results.map(&.body)

      filenames.any? { |f| f.includes?(".txt") }.should be_true

      assert_substring "and he said it was called “paprika hendl,”", bodies[0]
      assert_substring "or, the Modern Prometheus", bodies[1]
